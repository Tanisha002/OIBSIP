                    and statesman who also served as the 11th president of India</font>.
                Religion and spirituality were very important to him throughout his life.
                His desire to read and spend hours studying and learning Mathematics,
                proved to create a strong foundation in his initial stage of education.

                Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation)

                under Vikram Sarabhai, a renowned space scientist.
                In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the
                Indian Space Research Organisation (<font>ISRO</font>), where he started as a project
                director of SLV-III, India’s first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle.
                His dedication led to the development of 4 missile projects and due to this
                contribution, he earned the title of the <font>‘Missile Man of India’</font>.
                Later in 1992, Kalam was appointed as the
                Scientific Adviser to the Defence
                Minister and promoted to Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India in 1999.
